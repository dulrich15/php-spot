spot-php
========

PHP driven CMS for my Physics class.

I'm no longer actively using this project, actually. But I thought I would put it out there for people to check out.

I've since combined with the my ``docmaker`` project and ported the whole thing over to Django. My ``spot`` repo shows an early version of this, but I pulled it off the public repo until I can strip the confidential student infomation out. 

You can see it live at http://spot.davidjulrich.com --- I'm using it now!

Thanks,
Dave
